  "description" : "Ben Folds Five: Ben Folds (vocals, piano); Robert Sledge (bass); Darren Jessee (drums). Additional personnel: Ted Ehrhard (violin, viola); Chris Eubanks (cello). Recorded at Wave Castle, North Carolina in February 1995. All songs written by Ben Folds except \"Where's Summer B.?\" (Ben Folds/Darren Jessee), \"Alice Childress\" and \"The Last Polka\" (Ben Folds/Anna Goodman). In the mid-1990s, while legions of angst-ridden, guitar-brandishing alternative-rock groups were riding the post-Nirvana wave of success, North Carolina's Ben Folds Five quietly released its self-titled debut, which featured very little angst and no guitars. Cheeky even in name (the ensemble is actually a trio), the band presents a highly melodic fully formed sound, with Ben Folds's emotive vocals, witty lyrics, and energetic piano playing coasting gleefully over the rhythms of bassist Robert Sledge and drummer Darren Jessee. While Joe Jackson, Randy Newman, Elton John, and other like-minded performers are immediately clear as influences, Folds establishes his own identity with a quirky indie-rock aesthetic, whether he's offering up odes to production lines (the buoyant \"Jackson Cannery\"), anti-love songs (the gleeful \"Julianne\"), or eccentric character sketches (the lively \"Uncle Walter\"). BEN FOLDS FIVE's crowning moment, however, is the infectious, falsetto-laden \"Underground,\" which skewers the college-rock scene with smarts and killer songcraft. For fans of Folds--and melodic, piano-driven pop in general--this record is essential.",

A first finale for Costello's working relationship with the Attractions, Blood & Chocolate brings the group together for a series of songs that moves through garage noise (\"Uncomplicated\"), twisted folk-rock (\"Crimes of Paris\"), a harrowing Dylan-Lennon homage (\"I Want You\"), and other genre twistings. Perhaps the most underrated classic in the man's catalog, it carries six bonus tracks--including the fabulous \"Baby's Got a Brand New Hairdo\"--in this edition. --Rickey Wright",

  "description" : "The second album from Nick Drake came in 1970, and while not quite as melancholy as his debut, Five Leaves Left, there are certain brooding qualities that continued to propagate the Nick Drake mystique. Horns, flute, and strings arrangements lift such songs as \"At the Chime of a City Clock\" and \"Hazy Jane I\" and \"II\" out of the realm of sad, folk-guitar music into something jazzier and lighter, while the beautiful piano and simple guitar of \"One of These Things First\" laments what could have been without sounding like a song of despair. But two tracks featuring John Cale on various instruments (such as viola and harpsichord) have the dark fragility of \"Pink Moon\": the lovely \"Fly\" is a fragile apparition, and \"Northern Sky\" is a dreamy, brooding plea for long-lasting love. Definitely not the same mood music as his starker work, but still a fine showcase for Nick Drake. --Lorry Fleming",

  "description" : "This guest-studded CD relaunched Buddy Guy's career and set him toward the pinnacle of contemporary blues. Despite turns from Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, and others, it's Guy who burns brightest--and loudest. He delivers roaring, exuberant performances of classic R&B (\"Mustang Sally\"), old-time blues (\"Black Night\"), and house rockers (\"Where Is the Next One Coming From\"). Most poignant, though, is his seven-minute instrumental \"Rememberin' Stevie,\" which not only rekindles the fiery spirit of his own youth, but pays sensitive tribute to his late friend and admirer Stevie Ray Vaughan. This is the blueprint for Guy's current performing style. --Ted Drozdowski",

  "description" : "Arguably the last \"good\" BDP album before KRS-One took a slight misstep with Sex and Violence (and then had to reinvent himself on Return of the Boom Bap), Edutainment was a classic blend of puffed-chest bravado mixed with socially conscious missives. This multifaceted scope is best reflected in the album's three best-known songs: \"Love's Gonna Getcha,\" an antimaterialist, anticrime narrative; \"Ya Know the Rules,\" a furious rhyme pelting; and \"Beef,\" where KRS lays into the meat industry. Keeping the beats strictly b-boy are producers KRS, Kenny Parker, and others. Even if you're not a BDP completist, this album deserves to be in your collection. --Oliver Wang",

  "description" : "Even the musical wasteland that was the '80s did offer up a few beacons of hope, and LA power-poppers the Plimsouls were one of them. Granted, they're primarily known for one song, \"A Million Miles Away,\" one of the decade's musical highlights, but they had a lot more good material up their sleeve. \"Shaky City,\" the title track, and \"Play the Breaks,\" also stand out, and the quality never dips below wonderful. Led by Peter Case, they coulda been contenders; certainly their wiry pop music was appealing enough. For one reason or another, it never happened. But time has finally caught up with them (and that perfect song), and the world is finally ready for the Plimsouls. --Chris Nickson",

  "description" : "There's not a single dud in the trilogy of albums that singer/songwriter Nick Drake released during his all-too-short career. And 1968's Five Leaves Left--his first album--is certainly no exception. Drake's sensitive guitar work and sensitive vocals are backed by the baroque sounds of a chamber string group, and the platter's lyrics show maturity well beyond the age of their 20-year-old creator. Sparser than its follow-up, the jazzy Bryter Layter, but less tortured than Drake's dark final chapter, Pink Moon, Five Leaves Left is a classic British folk disc. Songs like \"River Man,\" \"The Thoughts of Mary Jane,\" and \"Day Is Done\" are among Drake's finest moments. Newcomers be forewarned: this music is as infectious as it is bleak, and a purchase of Drake's boxed set Fruit Tree might be a wise investment. --Jason Verlinde",

The follow-up \"Humpin'\" only made it to No. 60 on the R&B charts, but kept their fans happy. The most exciting aspect of III is that it also showcases the ballad side of the group, focusing on Charles Wilson as the romantic lead vocalist on \"Yearning for Your Love,\" which became a Top 5 R&B hit, and also hit pop charts, adding a new dimension to the Gap Band's overall sound. --Tom Vickers",

  "description" : "This is the album that brought it all together for the Brothers Wilson, and made the Gap Band a force to reckon with in both the R&B and pop worlds. The album contains two killer funk jams, both reaching the top of the R&B charts--\"Early in the Morning\" and \"You Dropped a Bomb on Me.\" But both songs also crossed over to become Top 40 pop hits, making the Gap Band a huge concert attraction. The other standout is the ballad \"Outstanding,\" another NO. 1 in R&B. Of all the Gap Band albums to get, this is the strongest, with the exception of their hits collection. Great for gettin' down on the dance floor or the bedroom--take your pick. --Tom Vickers",

Breaking into the club scene with their own blend of techno-disco in 1995, their debut album is the 80's electro-funk record of your dreams. Influenced by old school Chicago house and Detroit minimalist techno (all name checked on \"Teachers\"), Homework ranges from the warped electro that has become their trademark on \"Around the World\" and \"Da Funk\", to banging acid techno on \"Rollin'and Scratchin'\" and \"Alive\".

  "description" : "By 1969, black artists were following rock's lead and recording extended epics. At the forefront of such experimentation was big bad Isaac Hayes, coauthor of countless Stax classics and an artist in his own right. On this, his second album, Hayes takes two MOR-pop benchmarks, Burt Bacharach's \"Walk On By\" and Jimmy Webb's \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix,\" and spins them out into slow-building sermons lasting 12 and 18.5 minutes apiece. Heavily romantic, they predate by two years Barry White's symphonic adventures in the same style, revolutionizing soul music in the process. Meanwhile, on the album's third epic, the 10-minute \"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic,\" Hayes and his backing band the Bar-Kays wind up sounding, bizarrely, like a black Crazy Horse. --Barney Hoskyns",

  "description" : "Not as great as Innervisions (what is?), but quite probably better than Fulfillingness' First Finale, Hotter Than July is the last of the string of classic albums that included those milestones. While going for big statements only a couple of times during its 46 minutes--the celebratory reggae rocker \"Master Blaster (Jammin')\" and the Martin Luther King Jr. tribute \"Happy Birthday\"--the disc shows off a lot more than the expected high-level craftsmanship. Like humor: \"I Ain't Gonna Stand for It\" merges an affectionate burlesque of country music (\"Somebody's been rubbin' on my good-luck charm,\" he sings of a two-timing girlfriend) with a funk backbeat. And humanity: \"Do Like You\" celebrates family ties in an especially nice way, while \"Rocket Love\" and \"All I Do\" are among Wonder's most underappreciated love songs. This is worth buying for the deathless \"Master Blaster\" alone, but after you do, you'll be glad you own it all. --Rickey Wright",

  "description" : "This 1971 date was Washington's first as a leader, after playing and recording with the small organ combos of Charles Earland and Johnny \"Hammond\" Smith. It's unheard-of for a jazz musician to make his debut complete with strings, horns, and vocal group, but Washington apparently got the opportunity when the backing tracks were in place for a Hank Crawford album and Crawford was out of the country. Stranger still, Washington is usually playing alto here rather than his customary soprano or tenor. It was an instrument he hadn't played in years, and the result of his horn switching is a compellingly original sound that's almost sopranolike. Despite the circumstances, Washington brings a lot of himself to this music, making personal statements of two contemporary Marvin Gaye songs, \"Inner City Blues\" and \"Mercy, Mercy Me,\" and the standards \"Georgia on My Mind\" and \"I Loves You, Porgy.\" He also puts together an effective combination of Bill Withers's \"Ain't No Sunshine\" and J.J. Johnson's \"Theme from Man and Boy.\" Whether it's the tight combo of \"Inner City Blues\" or the full-blown orchestra with strings and backing vocals, this is soul jazz of the first rank. --Adam Rains",

  "description" : "One of Stevie Wonder's best albums, and the one where his more fanciful, free-form moments gel perfectly with his knack for irresistible pop singles, 1973's Innervisions swings between delicate and airy ballads, Latin-influenced rhythms (the hit \"Don't Worry 'Bout a Thing\"), and his own synth-heavy versions of gut-bucket soul (the determined spiritual questing of \"Higher Ground\"). The striking juxtaposition between \"Vision,\" a barely breathed hope that a world of peace might be upon us, and the great \"Living for the City,\" a funky, pulsing tale of racism, is powerful, haunting, and still all too relevant. --David Cantwell",

Not surprising since Key Lime Pie joined David Lowery's playful, ironic songwriting, Morgan Fichter's soaring violin, and Dennis Henderson's artful production. While the percussive cover \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\" and the chugging \"Jack Ruby\" have historically gotten the most attention on this record, Camper Van Beethoven gems like \"(I Was Born in a) Laundromat\" and \"All Her Favorite Fruit\" should not be overlooked. A classic. --Nick Heil",

  "description" : "Tragedy of tragedies: Sun Records legend Roy Orbison passed away only a few weeks after issuing this sunny comeback in 1989. Rescued from the oldies also-ran circuit by his membership in the Traveling Wilburys--alongside fellow legends Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, and ELO's Jeff Lynne--the Wayfaring One implemented these stellar pals and others on Mystery Girl and even allowed his son to compose some lyrics for him. Wonder of wonders: his angelic tenor rang true on every track and set the stage for what might've been a huge pop-culture renaissance. No need to fret about the \"if only\"s. One spin through the radio-chummy \"You Got It,\" and the \"Pretty Woman\" legacy is crystal clear. We're lucky he was able to record it. --Tom Lanham",

  "description" : "This CD comes from the marathon 1956 Prestige sessions with the first of Miles Davis's great quintets: John Coltrane on tenor, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums. The group recorded four LPs for Prestige, contemporaneous with the early Columbia material recently celebrated on the Davis-Coltrane Complete Columbia Studio Sessions. Relaxin' emphasizes Davis's concentrated ballad style, with his middle-register trumpet played through a Harmon mute very close to the microphone. What might be a mere buzz in lesser hands becomes restrained passion and detailed expression on the slow tempos of \"You're My Everything\" and \"It Could Happen to You,\" while Davis conveys joy on the faster tempo of \"I Could Write a Book.\" \"If I Were a Bell,\" from Frank Loesser's then contemporary Guys and Dolls, is another melodic highlight.",

  "description" : "By 1993, hip-hop was transitioning from an organic form of musical expression into a big business fabricating stars. With many icons from his era either aging or losing their relevance (e.g., Chuck D, Rakim), KRS-ONE dropped a gem of an album that not only navigated the sound of the day but led the charge. Shedding his previous Boogie Down Productions moniker, KRS-One's Return of the Boom Bap is not just an album: it's KRS's call to arms for the return of hard beats and real rap in hip-hop music. The former took many forms, thanks to the recruitment of Gang Starr's DJ Premier, who was hitting his stride as hip-hop's preeminent beat-maker. Primo crafted the classic head-nod rhythm of the title track, the bump of \"Outta Here,\" an autobiographical tale of KRS-One's rise in hip-hop, and the dancehall-inspired riddims of \"Black Cop\" and \"Sound of da Police.\" Lyrically, KRS-One displayed variety in both style and content, meshing old-school bombast (\"Mortal Thought\"), consciousness (\"Higher Level\"), and crafty and conceptual wordplay (\"I Can't Wake Up\"). The album opens with KRS-One boasting, even decreeing, that he would \"be here forever.\" At the crossroads, this album made it seem true. --Joseph Patel",

  "description" : "Though he lacked the improvisational fire of John Coltrane and the restless curiosity of Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins played with a rich, round tone that complimented his melodic inclinations, making him the most accessible of the post-bop musicians. Saxophone Colossus is the most successful of the late '50s albums that made his reputation. Rollins' playing never falters; he's backed by the redoubtable Max Roach on drums, Tommy Flannagan on piano, and Doug Watkins on bass. Rollins is equally at home with the lilting Caribbean air of \"St. Thomas,\" standards (\"You Don't Know What Love Is\"), blues (\"Strode Rode,\" featuring a driving Tommy Flannagan solo), and a smoldering version of Brecht-Weill's \"Moritat\" (better known as \"Mac the Knife\"). If you are new to jazz, there is no better place to start than Saxophone Colossus. --Steven Mirkin",

Kelly, Diane Warren, Tony Rich, and Kenny G. R&B songbirds in their own right, Shanice Wilson and Chante Moore even show up on backing vocals. The album doesn't quite live up to this overdose of talent; it's too crammed with boring ballads (even if Braxton's low, husky vocals are perfectly suited for them, especially the wrenching watermark of the album, \"Un-Break My Heart\"). It's when she slips into a sultry groove on \"Come On Over Here\" and the smash single \"You're Makin Me High\" that she really shines. --Rebecca Wallwork",

  "description" : "Considering that Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith, the English duo known as Tears for Fears, were avid followers of Arthur Janov, father of the Primal Scream form of mental therapy, it wasn't surprising that one of their biggest hits was titled \"Shout.\" What was surprising was how the two managed to take all their deep-rooted inner turmoil and make such positively buoyant music. Case in point: their other Songs from the Big Chair-spawned, No. 1 hit, \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World,\" was a meditative contemplation of the struggle for power within interpersonal relationships as a metaphor for global supremacy--which, thank god, had a good beat so you could at least dance to it. --Billy Altman",

  "description" : "By the time the Jam released Sound Affects, they were well on their way out of their angled, clean-guitar choppiness and headed toward a pop amalgam that loaned itself to horns, strings, and more. \"Pretty Green\" is something like its title, a very pretty little tune that hints at things other than what lies on the rest of the album. \"That's Entertainment\" became the band's acoustic zenith, urgent and strong in its lyrical collision of everyday life and postmodern society mechanisms. There are danceable hoppers such as \"Start!\" and motoring energizers such as \"Set the House Ablaze,\" and all of it seems to coincide in a great, effortless sway of styles as they run into and through each other. --Andrew Bartlett",

Then he got even more successful making the kind of records he wanted to make, waxing socio-political (the title track from the epochal What's Going On album), scoring blaxploitation films (\"Trouble Man\"), and getting real interested in sex (\"Let's Get It On,\" \"I Want You,\" \"Got to Give It Up\"). All this-and more-make up the 20 tunes on the second disc. Motown. 1995.",

  "description" : "Chock full of hits and nicely assembled, this two-CD collection focuses on Michael before he left the Motown cocoon, hooked up with Quincy Jones, and changed the sound of black pop with Off the Wall. Does the relatively safe vibe and the less-than-groundbreaking nature of the music make these songs any less enjoyable or memorable? No way--especially for boomers who grew up with MJ. All the hits are here, from the chirpy smash \"Rockin' Robin\" to the yearning \"Got to Be There\" (check those high notes!) and a handful of J5 tracks (chief among them the impassioned \"I'll Be There\"). For fans of R&B and for Michael-maniacs, this is a must. --Amy Linden",

  "description" : "Why doesn't Toronto's Bruce Cockburn have the same high-level critical reputation and midlevel cult following as Richard Thompson? After all, they're both dazzling, Celtic-Islamic rock guitar pickers and the writers of vivid if gloomy songs which they deliver in foggy baritones. The big difference is Cockburn's left-wing Christianity, which can be as unrelentingly earnest as Bono's. Cockburn lightens up a little bit on The Charity of Night; he adds Laurie Anderson-like, film noir monologs to four songs and allows nakedly romantic feelings to emerge in two quietly pretty love songs. The prominent presence of bassist Rob Wasserman and vibist Gary Burton give a jazzy elasticity to Cockburn's usual folk rock. Cockburn's reputation among his fellow musicians is reflected in guest appearances by Bonnie Raitt, Bob Weir, Patty Larkin, Ani DiFranco, and Jonatha Brooke--maybe the public will catch up this time around. --Geoffrey Himes",

  "description" : "A former member of the late '70s English punk band the Skids, guitarist/vocalist Stuart Adamson went to Scotland in 1982 to form a group whose goals were to regain the idealism and passion he felt the punk/new wave movement had lost through commercialization. Tapping U2's producer, Steve Lillywhite, then known for his highly textured, expansive sound, Adamson realized his vision on Big Country's 1983 debut. Propelled by the hit single \"In a Big Country,\" and featuring such rousingly evocative fare as \"Fields of Fire\" and \"Harvest Home,\" the group's decidedly Scotch-Irish tone prefigured the Celtic music boom by a good 10 years. --Billy Altman",

  "description" : "In late 1989 and early 1990, Galaxie played frequently in Europe, especially in the UK, garnering rave reviewsacross the board. In the spring of 1990, Dean decided to move back to New York while his bandmates stayed in Boston.They recorded their third album, This Is Our Music, in the summer of 1990, again with Kramer. The albums title wasnicked from Ornette Colemans classic for Atlantic, recorded 30 years earlier. Although This Is Our Music wouldeventually become Galaxie 500s swan song, it seems like another subtle step forward in the bands brillianttrajectory. There are more blended vocals, Naomis best singing on record (a cover of Yoko Onos \"Listen, the SnowIs Falling\"), and another set of stunning originals. The box set includes a few fantastic out- takes from thissession, including the Young Marble Giants \"Final Day\" and a ripping leap through the Velvets \"Here She ComesNow,\" as well as a cover of the Rutles classic \"Cheese & Onions,\" recorded for a Rutles tribute record assembled byKramer. The press reaction to This Is Our Music was classically adulatory. The band played the UK festival circuit, embarked on their first full-blown American tour, and seemed on the verge of another major evolutionary leap, when Dean announced he was leaving the band.",

  "description" : "With his second album, Elvis Costello firmly established himself as one of rock's--not just punk/new wave's--premier singer-songwriters. Building on the promise of his '77 debut, My Aim Is True, Costello put together a backing touring trio, the Attractions (keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas, and drummer Pete Thomas), and their versatility helped Costello define himself as a punk-fuelled power-pop force. Sporting influences ranging from Bob Dylan (the stream-of-consciousness \"Pump It Up\") to Burt Bacharach (the Dusty Springfield-worthy \"Little Triggers\"), this '78-released collection also features such righteously angry anthems as the anti-conformist \"This Year's Girl,\" and the anti-MOR classic, \"Radio Radio.\" --Billy Altman",

  "description" : "Excuse us for caring, but there are a few things shamefully wrong about this long overdue salute to the immortal Nutty Boys. For starters, any self-respecting Madness package should open with \"One Step Beyond,\" not end with it. And a meager 12 tracks (43 minutes) from the hugely prolific ska/pop kings of the early '80s is a tad miserly. To justify the title, Geffen could have made stronger efforts to license gems like \"Baggy Trousers,\" \"Night Train to Cairo,\" and \"Embarrassment\" from Sire. The liner note ode by Dicky Barrett of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones is small compensation. --Jeff Bateman",

  "description" : "Back in the early '80s, this Michigan family act was dismissed by some as a poor man's version of the more successful Jacksons. Yet in El DeBarge's quavering tones (a clear influence on Babyface), DeBarge had a singer who eschewed soul pyrotechnics and went straight for the pathos, which colored even DeBarge's uptempo songs such as \"Rhythm of the Night\" with a sadness and yearning that still resonates today. They may never have become megastars, but DeBarge had incredible songs, chief among them the haunting \"Time Will Reveal,\" the soaring \"All This Love,\" and one of the most beautiful and passionate songs in recent memory, \"In a Special Way.\" With early solo work from El as well as li'l bro Chico (never part of the family act), this is a well-compiled set that gives some love to a group that never quite got its due. --Amy Linden",

  "description" : "In the late '60s, Sinatra fan Gaye commissioned arrangements of several standards from pop-jazz composer Bobby Scott. Neither Gaye nor Scott was satisfied with the performances (though a number of the vocal tracks he cut at the time appeared on the posthumous album Romantically Yours), but in the midst of personal turmoil a decade or so later, Gaye returned to the tapes. Spinning a web of overdubbed voices, he found something in the likes of \"I Won't Cry Anymore,\" \"Funny, Not Much,\" and \"Why Did I Choose You?\" that transformed the songs into a corollary to Here, My Dear, the 1978 concept album that traced the tale of his shattered first marriage. As pained and beautiful as that set, if much less angry in its essential assumptions, Vulnerable is a brief (seven three-minute tracks plus three alternate versions) but potent document of Gaye's vocal mastery and emotional incisiveness. --Rickey Wright",

  "description" : "Originally formed as the Jazziacs in 1964, Kool & The Gang took their new identity in 1969 when they signed with DeLite Records. Led by bassist Robert \"Kool\" Bell, this horn-driven band left their jazz roots behind when they combined the rhythmic elements of funk with the party flavor of disco. With no formal lead vocalist, their songs relied more on grooves and instrumental power than pretty lyrics sung by a pretty voice (though this would change in the 1980s when they added lead singer J.T. Taylor). Released in 1973, Wild and Peaceful broke them to a wider crossover audience. Fueled by three killer hit singles--\"Funky Stuff,\" \"Jungle Boogie,\" and \"Hollywood Swinging\"--the Kool & the Gang sound hits full throttle here. For killer party jams, this is the one. --Tom Vickers",

She's all over the place--\"I'm Gonna Soothe You\" is soul, \"Only Once\" honky-tonk, \"I Can't Make It Alone\" hard-edged pop--but it all works because McKee has finally reconciled her spirituality with her need for the sensual, over-the-top anthem. --David Cantwell",
