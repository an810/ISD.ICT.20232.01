  "description" : "This CD comes from the marathon 1956 Prestige sessions with the first of Miles Davis's great quintets: John Coltrane on tenor, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums. The group recorded four LPs for Prestige, contemporaneous with the early Columbia material recently celebrated on the Davis-Coltrane Complete Columbia Studio Sessions. Relaxin' emphasizes Davis's concentrated ballad style, with his middle-register trumpet played through a Harmon mute very close to the microphone. What might be a mere buzz in lesser hands becomes restrained passion and detailed expression on the slow tempos of \"You're My Everything\" and \"It Could Happen to You,\" while Davis conveys joy on the faster tempo of \"I Could Write a Book.\" \"If I Were a Bell,\" from Frank Loesser's then contemporary Guys and Dolls, is another melodic highlight.",
