  "description" : "Released in March 1994 exactly a year before Selena would be shot and killed by her ex-fan club president, this CD demonstrates a band at the peak of its creative force. The hits were obvious--the eloquent \"Amor Prohibido,\" on love conducted in secret, and \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,\" a magical pop tune that could work in any dance club. \"Cobarde\" and \"El Chico\" were easy cumbias to like; \"Fotos y Recuerdos\" was an ironic message on having only photographs and memories left. But highly underrated was the lovely and stoic \"No Me Queda Mas,\" on facing the end, yet keeping a sense of dignity and self-worth. --Ramiro Burr",
