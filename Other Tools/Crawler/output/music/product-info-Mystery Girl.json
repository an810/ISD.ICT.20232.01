  "description" : "Tragedy of tragedies: Sun Records legend Roy Orbison passed away only a few weeks after issuing this sunny comeback in 1989. Rescued from the oldies also-ran circuit by his membership in the Traveling Wilburys--alongside fellow legends Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, and ELO's Jeff Lynne--the Wayfaring One implemented these stellar pals and others on Mystery Girl and even allowed his son to compose some lyrics for him. Wonder of wonders: his angelic tenor rang true on every track and set the stage for what might've been a huge pop-culture renaissance. No need to fret about the \"if only\"s. One spin through the radio-chummy \"You Got It,\" and the \"Pretty Woman\" legacy is crystal clear. We're lucky he was able to record it. --Tom Lanham",
