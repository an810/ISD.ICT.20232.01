  "description" : "Not as great as Innervisions (what is?), but quite probably better than Fulfillingness' First Finale, Hotter Than July is the last of the string of classic albums that included those milestones. While going for big statements only a couple of times during its 46 minutes--the celebratory reggae rocker \"Master Blaster (Jammin')\" and the Martin Luther King Jr. tribute \"Happy Birthday\"--the disc shows off a lot more than the expected high-level craftsmanship. Like humor: \"I Ain't Gonna Stand for It\" merges an affectionate burlesque of country music (\"Somebody's been rubbin' on my good-luck charm,\" he sings of a two-timing girlfriend) with a funk backbeat. And humanity: \"Do Like You\" celebrates family ties in an especially nice way, while \"Rocket Love\" and \"All I Do\" are among Wonder's most underappreciated love songs. This is worth buying for the deathless \"Master Blaster\" alone, but after you do, you'll be glad you own it all. --Rickey Wright",
