  "description" : "By 1993, hip-hop was transitioning from an organic form of musical expression into a big business fabricating stars. With many icons from his era either aging or losing their relevance (e.g., Chuck D, Rakim), KRS-ONE dropped a gem of an album that not only navigated the sound of the day but led the charge. Shedding his previous Boogie Down Productions moniker, KRS-One's Return of the Boom Bap is not just an album: it's KRS's call to arms for the return of hard beats and real rap in hip-hop music. The former took many forms, thanks to the recruitment of Gang Starr's DJ Premier, who was hitting his stride as hip-hop's preeminent beat-maker. Primo crafted the classic head-nod rhythm of the title track, the bump of \"Outta Here,\" an autobiographical tale of KRS-One's rise in hip-hop, and the dancehall-inspired riddims of \"Black Cop\" and \"Sound of da Police.\" Lyrically, KRS-One displayed variety in both style and content, meshing old-school bombast (\"Mortal Thought\"), consciousness (\"Higher Level\"), and crafty and conceptual wordplay (\"I Can't Wake Up\"). The album opens with KRS-One boasting, even decreeing, that he would \"be here forever.\" At the crossroads, this album made it seem true. --Joseph Patel",
