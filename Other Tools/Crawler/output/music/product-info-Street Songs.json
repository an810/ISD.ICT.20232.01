  "description" : "Rick James later made ludicrous attempts to keep up with Prince, but on 1981's Street Songs, he stands in no one's shadow. This is, of course, the album that gave us \"Super Freak,\" but James also scores with several funk protest numbers, including the bitter \"Mr. Policeman\" and the celebratory \"Below the Funk (Pass the J).\" Prince ended up running a much longer way with the \"punk funk\" ball; still, James executed more than one or two good plays here. --Rickey Wright",
