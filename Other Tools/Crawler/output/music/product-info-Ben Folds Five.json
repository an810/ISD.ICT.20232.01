  "description" : "Ben Folds Five: Ben Folds (vocals, piano); Robert Sledge (bass); Darren Jessee (drums). Additional personnel: Ted Ehrhard (violin, viola); Chris Eubanks (cello). Recorded at Wave Castle, North Carolina in February 1995. All songs written by Ben Folds except \"Where's Summer B.?\" (Ben Folds/Darren Jessee), \"Alice Childress\" and \"The Last Polka\" (Ben Folds/Anna Goodman). In the mid-1990s, while legions of angst-ridden, guitar-brandishing alternative-rock groups were riding the post-Nirvana wave of success, North Carolina's Ben Folds Five quietly released its self-titled debut, which featured very little angst and no guitars. Cheeky even in name (the ensemble is actually a trio), the band presents a highly melodic fully formed sound, with Ben Folds's emotive vocals, witty lyrics, and energetic piano playing coasting gleefully over the rhythms of bassist Robert Sledge and drummer Darren Jessee. While Joe Jackson, Randy Newman, Elton John, and other like-minded performers are immediately clear as influences, Folds establishes his own identity with a quirky indie-rock aesthetic, whether he's offering up odes to production lines (the buoyant \"Jackson Cannery\"), anti-love songs (the gleeful \"Julianne\"), or eccentric character sketches (the lively \"Uncle Walter\"). BEN FOLDS FIVE's crowning moment, however, is the infectious, falsetto-laden \"Underground,\" which skewers the college-rock scene with smarts and killer songcraft. For fans of Folds--and melodic, piano-driven pop in general--this record is essential.",
