  "description" : "Arguably the last \"good\" BDP album before KRS-One took a slight misstep with Sex and Violence (and then had to reinvent himself on Return of the Boom Bap), Edutainment was a classic blend of puffed-chest bravado mixed with socially conscious missives. This multifaceted scope is best reflected in the album's three best-known songs: \"Love's Gonna Getcha,\" an antimaterialist, anticrime narrative; \"Ya Know the Rules,\" a furious rhyme pelting; and \"Beef,\" where KRS lays into the meat industry. Keeping the beats strictly b-boy are producers KRS, Kenny Parker, and others. Even if you're not a BDP completist, this album deserves to be in your collection. --Oliver Wang",
