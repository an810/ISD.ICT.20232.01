  "description" : "Behind every great suspense film lies the shadow of M, a fact-based drama that is the first and, perhaps, the ultimate portrait of a serial killer. Peter Lorre's flawless performance as a psychotic child murderer elicits feelings of both fear and pity. Lorre (Casablanca), in his first starring role, conveys the agony of a man driven by his compulsions, tormented by self-loathing, and hunted by both the criminal underworld and the police. M, director Fritz Lang's (Metropolis) first sound film and personal favorite, skillfully blends innovative camerawork, fine acting, and atmospheric settings. This version includes the often missing final scene and a restored sound track.",
