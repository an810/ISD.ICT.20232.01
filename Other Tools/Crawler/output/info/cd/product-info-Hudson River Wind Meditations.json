  "description" : "Lou Reeds fans have learned to expect the unexpected, but his latest work may still come as a surprise. After four decades in the rock spotlight, Lou Reed has turned his attention to the world of meditation music, inviting listeners on a relaxing journey to the hidden territory of his inner landscape. With Lou Reed's Inner Spaces, the iconic art rocker presents his first album created specifically for quiet contemplation. A practitioner of yoga and tai chi for many years, Lou Reed brings his unique sensitivity and knowledge of a broad spectrum of musical genres to provide a tranquil bed of soothing harmonics that open the heart and settle the mind. Like the music Reed composed for meditation and absorption of the photographic image in his book Lou Reed's New York (Steidl, 2006), the pieces on this hypnotic album wash away tension and negative energy with sparse instrumentation and subtle waves of electronic sound. Includes a bonus CD featuring Imaginary Shower, a guided relaxation exercise by Lou Reed's acupuncturist and healer, Dr. Shelley Peng.",
