  "description" : "For those who can't get enough of those Barney songs, here's a made-for-video show packed full of song and dance. The story line is oh-so thin as Barney and his friends sing 27 songs in only 56 minutes, so Barney is usually singing or introducing a new song. For anyone who has been watching the decade that Barney has been on the airwaves, most of the songs are Barney standards: \"Mr. Sun,\" \"The Airplane Song,\" \"Baby Bop Hop,\" and \"I Love You.\" They are mixed in with all-time favorites \"Itsy Bitsy Spider,\" \"A Camping We Will Go,\" and the like. Many of Barney's original kid friends return looking much older and wiser. No big landmark production here, just a \"greatest hits\" of Barney tunes that should have fans singing and dancing around the tube for nearly an hour.",
