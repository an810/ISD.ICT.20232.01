  "description" : "Basically, this is a collection of songs from 30 years of Sesame Street, in which sweet Elmo and his Muppet pals are joined by David Alan Grier, Jon Stewart, Gloria Estefan, the Fugees, Shawn Colvin, and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones. Grier (of the comically sour face) and Stewart (of the ironic smile) provide some funny stuff, and the Muppets share songs with the musical guests. This nonstop revue is a blast for parents as well as little ones. --Tom Keogh",
