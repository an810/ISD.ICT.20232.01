  "description" : "For all but the most apathetic viewers, this concert souvenir is enjoyable in inverse proportion to familiarity with the real-life Woodstock '99 festival: the less you know about the hour-to-hour experiences of the audience and the event's violent denouement, the more you can enjoy the show. This 2½-hour summation, which offers one song each from 29 of the artists that appeared, can be viewed as a grab bag of funk, rock, hip-hop, and pop spanning several generations of performers, from show opener James Brown (\"Sex Machine\") to bad-boy rockers Limp Bizkit (\"Show Me What You Got\"), congregating under the would-be \"brand\" (as event promoters have baldly called it) first established on Yasgur's farm 30 years earlier.",
