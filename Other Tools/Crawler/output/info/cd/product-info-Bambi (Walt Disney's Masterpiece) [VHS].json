  "description" : "Reflecting an age of innocence and a time of wonder, no film better captures the pure magic of Disney than BAMBI -- the world's most endearing animated tale about the beauty of nature and the miracle of life. Nominated for three Academy Awards(R), this immortal blend of classic storytelling and unforgettable characters is most fondly remembered as Walt Disney's all-time favorite picture. As morning light breaks across the meadow, a new prince of the forest is born. Soon Bambi emerges from the thicket on wobbly legs, much to the delight of his new friends, Thumper, the playful rabbit, and Flower, the bashful yet lovable skunk. But the fun of skating on \"stiff water,\" nibbling fresh blossoms, and frolicking through the woods is only the beginning. Exploring his new world, and guided by the wisdom of Friend Owl, Bambi learns valuable lessons with every adventure --experiencing love, loss, growth, and renewal along the way. Fully restored to its original theatrical splendor, this digitally remastered video edition of BAMBI can now take its place among your most cherished family keepsakes. Relive Disney's extraordinary movie masterpiece \"filled with laughter and inspired animation!\" (Time Magazine)",
