  "description" : "This trio of crime-fighting superheroines must work around kindergarten obligations, and if you've seen the Cartoon Network series you know they must save the world before bedtime. But they rise to the challenge with the help of their guardian-creator, Professor Utonium. In the Emmy-nominated title episode, Bubbles gets fed up with being \"the cute one,\" while her comrades get the better assignments, so she takes on a series of ugly baddies, resulting in many fires and explosions. There are five episodes on this 60-minute tape, including the double-episode \"Uh-Oh Dynamo,\" which finds the girls battling a monster at the city park. The trio finally vanquishes it from inside a huge robot, but not before the entire downtown appears leveled. In \"Mr. Mojo's Rising,\" the girls must rescue the professor when he is kidnapped by an evil megabrained monkey. \"Powerpuff Bluff\" introduces three hoodlums who impersonate the girls and rip off Townsville's denizens, landing the real girls a spell in the pokey. \"Cat Man Do\" will teach youngsters to go the shelter for their pets, as the kitty (voiced by Mark Hamill) the gals \"rescue\" from a crimelord's compound turns out to be a mind- controlling fiend. Parents scrutinizing violent content, beware; otherwise for ages 7 and up. --Kimberly Heinrichs",
