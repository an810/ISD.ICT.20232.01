  "description" : "As Carole King herself puts it during this concert performance in Hartford, Connecticut, the tunes on this video will represent either a trip down memory lane for the viewer--or a music-history lesson. King includes a couple of unfamiliar songs (from her then-new 1993 album, Colour of Your Dreams), but devotes most of this 85-minute set to the hits and highlights of her career, with a large, energetic band and backup singers (including her daughter). Those include such early song-writing successes as \"One Fine Day,\" \"Up on the Roof,\" and \"Natural Woman,\" as well as the still-classic tunes from her ground-breaking Tapestry album: \"So Far Away,\" \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\", \"It's Too Late,\" and \"You've Got a Friend.\" King herself is frisky as a pony, working the stage with the flair of Tina Turner and even bringing out unlikely guest-star guitarist Slash to provide chunky, chugging guitar on \"Locomotion.\" --Marshall Fine",
