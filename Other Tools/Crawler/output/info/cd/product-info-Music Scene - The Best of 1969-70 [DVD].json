  "description" : "A ratings disaster when it premiered on the ABC network on September 22, 1969 (and lasting a mere 16 weeks before cancellation), Music Scene now stands as a sublime time capsule of the \"flower power\" era. Although it was smartly conceived by the hipper-than-average producers of the controversial Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, the show was riskily scheduled opposite ratings juggernauts Gunsmoke and Laugh-In, and its fate was sealed. Now, with the passage of decades, these shows display a laudable effort to lure serious rock music into the pop-cultural mainstream--there were few if any opportunities for these acts to gain prime-time TV exposure, so it wasn't unusual to find Janis Joplin, Sly & the Family Stone, or Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young colliding on the guest list with bubble-gum pop stars like Bobby Sherman and MOR crooners like Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme.",
