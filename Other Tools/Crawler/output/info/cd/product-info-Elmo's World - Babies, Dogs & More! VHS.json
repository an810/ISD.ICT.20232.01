  "description" : "Sesame Street's cheerful redhead chuckles his way through this delightful 50-minute compilation of three favorite \"Elmo's World\" episodes. First come the babies: real babies, Muppet babies, and animal babies. With help from Mister Noodle, a cast of Muppets, and video vignettes featuring humans, Elmo discovers what babies can do and how to play with them. Next come the dogs. Once again, Elmo's on the move--this time to share important tips about respecting the family pet. The final episode examines life on the farm. Viewers will observe youngsters accomplishing daily farm chores as well as Muppet farmers and barn animals punning around. As Elmo bops around his house (simply drawn and \"furnished\" with color crayon sketches), he chats with Dorothy the pet goldfish, poses questions to Mister Noodle, and tunes in to his friendly television for helpful cartoons presented by \"The Baby Channel,\" \"The Dog Channel,\" and of course, \"The Farm Channel.\" Educational and entertaining for the younger crowd, each segment explores its topic using a variety of creative, quick-paced methods, enhanced by an upbeat soundtrack. (Ages 3 to 6) --Liane Thomas",
