  "description" : "One of the most startling, exciting live performances in rock history is presented here in all its glory. The Jimi Hendrix Experience were already making a name for themselves in England but were little known in the States when they appeared at Monterey in June 1967; that all changed after this gig, which saw Hendrix and his trio play an electrifying mix of originals (\"Purple Haze,\" \"Foxy Lady,\" \"The Wind Cries Mary\") and covers (\"Hey Joe,\" \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" and the climactic \"Wild Thing,\" in which the guitarist set his instrument on fire). For a new high-definition digital transfer with a 5.1 audio mix, try The Complete Monterey Pop Festival on DVD. --Sam Graham",
