  "description" : "Motown's most versatile vocalist, Marvin Gaye essayed everything from fistfuls of future soul standards and hit duets with four different women (Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Tammi Terrell, and Diana Ross), to dark, brooding voodoo grooves (\"I Heard It Though the Grapevine\"), all of which are collected in the first 27 songs on this two-CD set. Then he got even more successful making the kind of records he wanted to make, waxing socio-political (the title track from the epochal What's Going On album), scoring blaxploitation films (\"Trouble Man\"), and getting real interested in sex (\"Let's Get It On,\" \"I Want You,\" \"Got to Give It Up\"). All this-and more-make up the 20 tunes on the second disc. Motown. 1995.",
