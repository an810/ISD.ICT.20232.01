  "description" : "This is the album that brought it all together for the Brothers Wilson, and made the Gap Band a force to reckon with in both the R&B and pop worlds. The album contains two killer funk jams, both reaching the top of the R&B charts--\"Early in the Morning\" and \"You Dropped a Bomb on Me.\" But both songs also crossed over to become Top 40 pop hits, making the Gap Band a huge concert attraction. The other standout is the ballad \"Outstanding,\" another NO. 1 in R&B. Of all the Gap Band albums to get, this is the strongest, with the exception of their hits collection. Great for gettin' down on the dance floor or the bedroom--take your pick. --Tom Vickers",
