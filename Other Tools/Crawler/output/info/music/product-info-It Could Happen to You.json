  "description" : "Hardly as angst-ridden as Chet Baker's legend would suggest, 1958's It Could Happen to You is Baker still riding high, a star winsomely crooning some favorite standards over subtle accompaniment by small groups whose members include pianist Kenny Drew, bassist Sam Jones, and the unstoppable Philly Joe Jones on drums. Baker's boyish moods are perfect for the likes of \"How Long Has This Been Going On?,\" \"You're Driving Me Crazy,\" and (believe it) \"Everything Happens to Me.\" --Rickey Wright",
