  "description" : "The Godfather rushed this one to have some product to give Polydor, with whom he'd signed in mid-1971. You'd hardly know it, though, from the mellow likes of \"Blues & Pants\" or the lengthy vamp \"Escape-ism\" (also included in its complete, unedited version at nearly 20 minutes). The title tune is included in a different, later take than the hit single that dominated soul radio that summer--but still, as the song itself happily acknowledges, smokin'! --Rickey Wright",
