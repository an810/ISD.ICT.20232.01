  "description" : "The second album from Nick Drake came in 1970, and while not quite as melancholy as his debut, Five Leaves Left, there are certain brooding qualities that continued to propagate the Nick Drake mystique. Horns, flute, and strings arrangements lift such songs as \"At the Chime of a City Clock\" and \"Hazy Jane I\" and \"II\" out of the realm of sad, folk-guitar music into something jazzier and lighter, while the beautiful piano and simple guitar of \"One of These Things First\" laments what could have been without sounding like a song of despair. But two tracks featuring John Cale on various instruments (such as viola and harpsichord) have the dark fragility of \"Pink Moon\": the lovely \"Fly\" is a fragile apparition, and \"Northern Sky\" is a dreamy, brooding plea for long-lasting love. Definitely not the same mood music as his starker work, but still a fine showcase for Nick Drake. --Lorry Fleming",
