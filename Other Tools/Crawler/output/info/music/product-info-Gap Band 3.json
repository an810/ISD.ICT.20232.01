  "description" : "After the preceding album's breakthrough into gold, the Gappers picked up where they left off, and continued the forward momentum on both the charts and the dance floor with this 1981 release. The Wilson Brothers had refined the funk aspect of their sound with \"Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me),\" their first No. 1 R&B hit. The follow-up \"Humpin'\" only made it to No. 60 on the R&B charts, but kept their fans happy. The most exciting aspect of III is that it also showcases the ballad side of the group, focusing on Charles Wilson as the romantic lead vocalist on \"Yearning for Your Love,\" which became a Top 5 R&B hit, and also hit pop charts, adding a new dimension to the Gap Band's overall sound. --Tom Vickers",
