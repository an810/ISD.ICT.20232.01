  "description" : "Originally formed as the Jazziacs in 1964, Kool & The Gang took their new identity in 1969 when they signed with DeLite Records. Led by bassist Robert \"Kool\" Bell, this horn-driven band left their jazz roots behind when they combined the rhythmic elements of funk with the party flavor of disco. With no formal lead vocalist, their songs relied more on grooves and instrumental power than pretty lyrics sung by a pretty voice (though this would change in the 1980s when they added lead singer J.T. Taylor). Released in 1973, Wild and Peaceful broke them to a wider crossover audience. Fueled by three killer hit singles--\"Funky Stuff,\" \"Jungle Boogie,\" and \"Hollywood Swinging\"--the Kool & the Gang sound hits full throttle here. For killer party jams, this is the one. --Tom Vickers",
