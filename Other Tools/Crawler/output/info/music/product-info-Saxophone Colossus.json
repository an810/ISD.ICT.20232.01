  "description" : "Though he lacked the improvisational fire of John Coltrane and the restless curiosity of Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins played with a rich, round tone that complimented his melodic inclinations, making him the most accessible of the post-bop musicians. Saxophone Colossus is the most successful of the late '50s albums that made his reputation. Rollins' playing never falters; he's backed by the redoubtable Max Roach on drums, Tommy Flannagan on piano, and Doug Watkins on bass. Rollins is equally at home with the lilting Caribbean air of \"St. Thomas,\" standards (\"You Don't Know What Love Is\"), blues (\"Strode Rode,\" featuring a driving Tommy Flannagan solo), and a smoldering version of Brecht-Weill's \"Moritat\" (better known as \"Mac the Knife\"). If you are new to jazz, there is no better place to start than Saxophone Colossus. --Steven Mirkin",
