  "description" : "When Barry White first burst onto the music scene in 1973--seemingly out of nowhere--he was dismissed by some critics as an Isaac Hayes imitator. Like Hayes (a chart maker since 1969), White had a deep baritone that made him a natural musical \"lover man,\" and even though his physique was a real contrast to the sexy image of Marvin Gaye or an early-'70s Al Green, the multitalented producer, songwriter, and artist knew that he had the kind of vocal style to win over a primarily female audience.",
