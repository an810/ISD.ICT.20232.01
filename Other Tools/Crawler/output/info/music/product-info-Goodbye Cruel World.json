  "description" : "Costello calls this his worst record, but while its ticky-tocky \"modern\" (1984) production often smothers the music, Goodbye Cruel World does contain some great songs, notably the ballads \"Home Truth\" and \"Love Field\" and the anti-Reagan protest \"Peace in Our Time.\" Rykodisc's CD is a necessity for at least two reasons: bonus tracks of Charles Brown's \"Get Yourself Another Fool\" and Richard Thompson's \"Withered and Died,\" the latter not listed on the packaging. --Rickey Wright",
