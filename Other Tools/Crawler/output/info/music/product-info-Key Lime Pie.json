  "description" : "Camper Van Beethoven's first record with bona fide crossover appeal, 1989's Key Lime Pie (Virgin), brought the celebrated indie band into the, ahem, lime light. Not surprising since Key Lime Pie joined David Lowery's playful, ironic songwriting, Morgan Fichter's soaring violin, and Dennis Henderson's artful production. While the percussive cover \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\" and the chugging \"Jack Ruby\" have historically gotten the most attention on this record, Camper Van Beethoven gems like \"(I Was Born in a) Laundromat\" and \"All Her Favorite Fruit\" should not be overlooked. A classic. --Nick Heil",
