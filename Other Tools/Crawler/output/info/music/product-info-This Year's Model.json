  "description" : "With his second album, Elvis Costello firmly established himself as one of rock's--not just punk/new wave's--premier singer-songwriters. Building on the promise of his '77 debut, My Aim Is True, Costello put together a backing touring trio, the Attractions (keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas, and drummer Pete Thomas), and their versatility helped Costello define himself as a punk-fuelled power-pop force. Sporting influences ranging from Bob Dylan (the stream-of-consciousness \"Pump It Up\") to Burt Bacharach (the Dusty Springfield-worthy \"Little Triggers\"), this '78-released collection also features such righteously angry anthems as the anti-conformist \"This Year's Girl,\" and the anti-MOR classic, \"Radio Radio.\" --Billy Altman",
