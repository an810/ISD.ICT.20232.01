  "description" : "That's \"Ms. Ross\" to you, bub--and this is your best bet when collecting the solo output of the former Supreme. The disc spans from her first solo hit, 1970's \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" through her four 1980 collaborations with Chic. Since 1994's Ultimate Collection repeats most of the material here, adding only six Supremes hits and a cover of \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\"--and 1993's Forever Diana is awfully padded--this is definitely the one for casual fans. --Bill Holdship",
