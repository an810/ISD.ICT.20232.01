  "description" : "By the time the Jam released Sound Affects, they were well on their way out of their angled, clean-guitar choppiness and headed toward a pop amalgam that loaned itself to horns, strings, and more. \"Pretty Green\" is something like its title, a very pretty little tune that hints at things other than what lies on the rest of the album. \"That's Entertainment\" became the band's acoustic zenith, urgent and strong in its lyrical collision of everyday life and postmodern society mechanisms. There are danceable hoppers such as \"Start!\" and motoring energizers such as \"Set the House Ablaze,\" and all of it seems to coincide in a great, effortless sway of styles as they run into and through each other. --Andrew Bartlett",
