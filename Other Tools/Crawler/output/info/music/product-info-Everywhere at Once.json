  "description" : "Even the musical wasteland that was the '80s did offer up a few beacons of hope, and LA power-poppers the Plimsouls were one of them. Granted, they're primarily known for one song, \"A Million Miles Away,\" one of the decade's musical highlights, but they had a lot more good material up their sleeve. \"Shaky City,\" the title track, and \"Play the Breaks,\" also stand out, and the quality never dips below wonderful. Led by Peter Case, they coulda been contenders; certainly their wiry pop music was appealing enough. For one reason or another, it never happened. But time has finally caught up with them (and that perfect song), and the world is finally ready for the Plimsouls. --Chris Nickson",
