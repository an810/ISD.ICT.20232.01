  "description" : "Chock full of hits and nicely assembled, this two-CD collection focuses on Michael before he left the Motown cocoon, hooked up with Quincy Jones, and changed the sound of black pop with Off the Wall. Does the relatively safe vibe and the less-than-groundbreaking nature of the music make these songs any less enjoyable or memorable? No way--especially for boomers who grew up with MJ. All the hits are here, from the chirpy smash \"Rockin' Robin\" to the yearning \"Got to Be There\" (check those high notes!) and a handful of J5 tracks (chief among them the impassioned \"I'll Be There\"). For fans of R&B and for Michael-maniacs, this is a must. --Amy Linden",
