  "description" : "\"A pissed off thirty-two year old, divorcee's version of 'This Year's Model,'\" Elvis Costello deems this 1986 album in the Rykodisc reissue's liner notes; if anything, given its raw sonics and Esperanto sleeve credits, it's even more perverse than that 1978 masterpiece. A first finale for Costello's working relationship with the Attractions, Blood & Chocolate brings the group together for a series of songs that moves through garage noise (\"Uncomplicated\"), twisted folk-rock (\"Crimes of Paris\"), a harrowing Dylan-Lennon homage (\"I Want You\"), and other genre twistings. Perhaps the most underrated classic in the man's catalog, it carries six bonus tracks--including the fabulous \"Baby's Got a Brand New Hairdo\"--in this edition. --Rickey Wright",
