  "description" : "One of Stevie Wonder's best albums, and the one where his more fanciful, free-form moments gel perfectly with his knack for irresistible pop singles, 1973's Innervisions swings between delicate and airy ballads, Latin-influenced rhythms (the hit \"Don't Worry 'Bout a Thing\"), and his own synth-heavy versions of gut-bucket soul (the determined spiritual questing of \"Higher Ground\"). The striking juxtaposition between \"Vision,\" a barely breathed hope that a world of peace might be upon us, and the great \"Living for the City,\" a funky, pulsing tale of racism, is powerful, haunting, and still all too relevant. --David Cantwell",
