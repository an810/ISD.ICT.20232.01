  "description" : "This 1971 date was Washington's first as a leader, after playing and recording with the small organ combos of Charles Earland and Johnny \"Hammond\" Smith. It's unheard-of for a jazz musician to make his debut complete with strings, horns, and vocal group, but Washington apparently got the opportunity when the backing tracks were in place for a Hank Crawford album and Crawford was out of the country. Stranger still, Washington is usually playing alto here rather than his customary soprano or tenor. It was an instrument he hadn't played in years, and the result of his horn switching is a compellingly original sound that's almost sopranolike. Despite the circumstances, Washington brings a lot of himself to this music, making personal statements of two contemporary Marvin Gaye songs, \"Inner City Blues\" and \"Mercy, Mercy Me,\" and the standards \"Georgia on My Mind\" and \"I Loves You, Porgy.\" He also puts together an effective combination of Bill Withers's \"Ain't No Sunshine\" and J.J. Johnson's \"Theme from Man and Boy.\" Whether it's the tight combo of \"Inner City Blues\" or the full-blown orchestra with strings and backing vocals, this is soul jazz of the first rank. --Adam Rains",
