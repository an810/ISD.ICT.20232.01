  "description" : "After their platinum debut album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, the 2 dope boys are back (the album debuted at #3 on Billboard's R&B chart, with the single \"Player's Ball\" going gold in just weeks). Atliens is a mix of alternative hip hop with a perfect blend of yesterday's funk. Once again, OutKast utilized the talents of Grammy-nominated mega-producers Organized Noize; Big Boi and Dre produce on their 2nd sample-free album, contributing to \"Elevators,\" the first single/video (video in rotation at BET, MTV and the Box).",
