  "description" : "This guest-studded CD relaunched Buddy Guy's career and set him toward the pinnacle of contemporary blues. Despite turns from Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, and others, it's Guy who burns brightest--and loudest. He delivers roaring, exuberant performances of classic R&B (\"Mustang Sally\"), old-time blues (\"Black Night\"), and house rockers (\"Where Is the Next One Coming From\"). Most poignant, though, is his seven-minute instrumental \"Rememberin' Stevie,\" which not only rekindles the fiery spirit of his own youth, but pays sensitive tribute to his late friend and admirer Stevie Ray Vaughan. This is the blueprint for Guy's current performing style. --Ted Drozdowski",
