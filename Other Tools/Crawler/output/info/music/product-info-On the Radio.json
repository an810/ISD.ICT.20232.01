  "description" : "The queen of Disco-known now for her fundamental conservatism but then known for her extended sex romps that pulsated as minutes turned to hours-Donna Summer recorded a series of hits that playfully courted decadence and consistent chart success. The versions here are the shorter 7\" versions. So if looking for the full 16-minute version of \"Love to Love You Baby,\" look elsewhere. But what is here is '70's disco at it's peak: \"Hot Stuff,\" \"Bad Girls,\" \"Last Dance,\" \"On the Radio,\" \"I Feel Love.\" the kind of stuff that makes weddings and frat parties what they are.",
