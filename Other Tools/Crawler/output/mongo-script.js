Nominated for three Academy Awards(R), this immortal blend of classic storytelling and unforgettable characters is most fondly remembered as Walt Disney's all-time favorite picture. As morning light breaks across the meadow, a new prince of the forest is born. Soon Bambi emerges from the thicket on wobbly legs, much to the delight of his new friends, Thumper, the playful rabbit, and Flower, the bashful yet lovable skunk. But the fun of skating on \"stiff water,\" nibbling fresh blossoms, and frolicking through the woods is only the beginning. Exploring his new world, and guided by the wisdom of Friend Owl, Bambi learns valuable lessons with every adventure --experiencing love, loss, growth, and renewal along the way. Fully restored to its original theatrical splendor, this digitally remastered video edition of BAMBI can now take its place among your most cherished family keepsakes.

After four decades in the rock spotlight, Lou Reed has turned his attention to the world of meditation music, inviting listeners on a relaxing journey to the hidden territory of his inner landscape. With Lou Reed's Inner Spaces, the iconic art rocker presents his first album created specifically for quiet contemplation. A practitioner of yoga and tai chi for many years, Lou Reed brings his unique sensitivity and knowledge of a broad spectrum of musical genres to provide a tranquil bed of soothing harmonics that open the heart and settle the mind. Like the music Reed composed for meditation and absorption of the photographic image in his book Lou Reed's New York (Steidl, 2006), the pieces on this hypnotic album wash away tension and negative energy with sparse instrumentation and subtle waves of electronic sound. Includes a bonus CD featuring Imaginary Shower, a guided relaxation exercise by Lou Reed's acupuncturist and healer, Dr. Shelley Peng.","details":"Product details Is Discontinued By Manufacturer ‏ : ‎ No Language ‏ : ‎ English Product Dimensions ‏ : ‎ 5.75 x 0.5 x 5 inches; 4 ounces Manufacturer ‏ : ‎ Sounds True Pages ‏ : ‎ 1 Item model number ‏ : ‎ 2069115 Date First Available ‏ : ‎ February 2, 2007 Label ‏ : ‎ Sounds True ASIN ‏ : ‎ 1591795540 Number of discs ‏ : ‎ 1 Best Sellers Rank: #215,226 in CDs & Vinyl (See Top 100 in CDs & Vinyl) #2,322 in New Age Meditation Music #17,450 in International Music (CDs & Vinyl) #91,369 in Rock (CDs & Vinyl) Customer Reviews: 4.0 4.0 out of 5 stars 30 ratings","title":"Hudson River Wind Meditations"});

D.A. Pennebaker (who teamed up with Richard Leacock, Albert Maysles, and other filmmakers here), fresh off his Bob Dylan documentary, Don't Look Back, captured the music and scene of the first real rock & roll festival. The Monterey Pop Festival of 1967, which laid the groundwork for Woodstock two years later, offered an amazing array of talent that was absolutely of that moment. And, as the intervening years have shown, this music stood the test of time: from the young Janis Joplin blowing the crowd away with \"Ball and Chain\" to an instrument-smashing performance by the Who to the surprisingly soul-stirring showing by Otis Redding. One particular highlight: the American debut of a little-known rock trio called the Jimi Hendrix Experience, which knocked the crowd out of its seats with a guitar sound that had never been heard before--and culminated with Hendrix setting his guitar ablaze and worshipping the flaming feedback. --Marshall Fine","details":"Product details Is Discontinued By Manufacturer ‏ : ‎ No Language ‏ : ‎ English Package Dimensions ‏ : ‎ 7.32 x 4.19 x 1.12 inches; 6.13 ounces Release date ‏ : ‎ June 17, 1997 Date First Available ‏ : ‎ October 1, 2006 Actors ‏ : ‎ Mamas & Papas, Animals, Joplin, Canned Heat, Hendrix Studio ‏ : ‎ Wea/Rhino ASIN ‏ : ‎ 156605334X Customer Reviews: 4.2 4.2 out of 5 stars 19 ratings","title":"Monterey Pop-the Film"});

The tape collects live concert footage and music videos of some of their best material. Rage Against the Machine starts with a passionate rendition of Bruce Springsteen's \"Ghost of Tom Joad\" live from the Irvine Meadows in Irvine, CA. The well-filmed performance captures Rage near the top of their game. (Will listeners ever see a collection that includes the concert from the Democratic Convention?) Seeing Zack de la Rocha interact with a large crowd and the band work a tight, incendiary groove is required to understand the appeal of the now-defunct political rock band. This is underscored by \"People of the Sun\" and four other songs live from the Rock Am Ring Festival in Germany, where Rage plays before what must be 100,000 people. Rage Against the Machine also includes three songs from the 1996 Reading Festival and a blistering \"Killing in the Name\" from the 1994 Pink Pop Festival. The second half is filled with six music videos, including \"Freedom\" and \"Memory of the Dead (Land and Liberty).\" Overall, the quality of the video is fine, but the music mix is low and a bit muddy. This is a problem for viewers who want to understand every word de la Rocha says. But there is a lyrics function, which is like subtitling. What musical crispness they lack in concert, Rage makes up for in intensity and energy. The real plus of the collection is that the videos are the uncensored versions, so getting this collection is not like replicating an MTV experience. The best moment of the DVD is a concert appearance by Tom Morello's mother, who plugs boycotting record stores that censor albums and introduces the \"best band in the f*cking universe: Rage Against the Machine!\" A must-own for fans of Rage Against the Machine and a useful 80 minutes for people who are complacent politically.","details":"Product details Is Discontinued By Manufacturer ‏ : ‎ No Product Dimensions ‏ : ‎ 5.7 x 7.6 x 1.6 inches; 11.2 ounces Run time ‏ : ‎ 1 hour and 31 minutes Release date ‏ : ‎ November 25, 1997 Date First Available ‏ : ‎ October 7, 2006 Actors ‏ : ‎ Rage Against The Machine Studio ‏ : ‎ Sony Legacy ASIN ‏ : ‎ 1573300497 Best Sellers Rank: #730,263 in CDs & Vinyl (See Top 100 in CDs & Vinyl) #5,511 in Alternative Metal (CDs & Vinyl) #59,670 in Alternative Rock (CDs & Vinyl) #269,014 in Rock (CDs & Vinyl) Customer Reviews: 4.3 4.3 out of 5 stars 116 ratings","title":"Rage Against The Machine"});

If you weren't lucky enough to catch them in your hometown (or you did and you crave more), now there's Stomp Out Loud, a special HBO performance that will bring the unusual musical feats right into your living room. You might just find yourself grabbing a broom or even your remote control to keep time. \"It's comedy, it's theater, it's very physical, it's energetic, it's occasionally quite terrifying,\" says one performer. Taking their show from the theater to the streets, this astonishing troupe can make music out of just about anything and just about anywhere. The opening sequence shows them dangling by harnesses across the back of a Manhattan billboard drumming on hubcaps, pipes, street signs, and plastic garbage pails, all the while swaying and keeping in perfect time. You know how you like to groove along to the radio while driving? Stomp doesn't need a radio--they use their hands to make their own music while cruising the streets of New York. Using just basketballs in a steamy alleyway, the troop creates an incredibly intricate dance and sound with the street, brick walls, and Dumpsters. Included in the program are the push broom, garbage can, and pole dances, just a few of their best-known sequences. Stomp Out Loud showcases the performers in the theater, out about town, and in short humorous vignettes (love the recurring card game!). All in all, they amaze. This well-produced video also includes a trailer and a special behind-the-scenes look at the making of Stomp Out Loud. --Dana Van Nest","details":"Product details Is Discontinued By Manufacturer ‏ : ‎ No Package Dimensions ‏ : ‎ 7.3 x 4 x 1.1 inches; 7.2 ounces Release date ‏ : ‎ April 21, 1998 Date First Available ‏ : ‎ October 25, 2006 Actors ‏ : ‎ Stomp Out Loud Studio ‏ : ‎ Hbo Home Video ASIN ‏ : ‎ 0783112793 Best Sellers Rank: #402,845 in CDs & Vinyl (See Top 100 in CDs & Vinyl) #25,169 in Soundtracks (CDs & Vinyl) Customer Reviews: 4.5 4.5 out of 5 stars 401 ratings","title":"Stomp Out Loud"});

While the Dane's dapper dignity fit the image of \"longhair\" music, Borge undercut it with broad physical comedy, clever spoofs, and off-the-cuff wit. A pioneer in the field of live comedy recordings, Borge is nevertheless best appreciated on video, and The Best of Victor Borge Acts One and Two captures a 90-minute concert that includes many of his most famous routines. He chides late-arriving members of the Minneapolis audience (\"I come from Copenhagen and was here before you!\"), falls off the piano bench, and reads his sheet music upside down. There are a few unwitting guests: a stagehand drafted to turn Borge's pages, soprano Marylyn Mulvey who tries to sing a Verdi aria through Borge's teasing and scolding, and Sahan Arzruni as he and Borge play a two-piano Hungarian rhapsody on a single piano by climbing over and around each other. Borge also presents an opera \"written by Mozart but credited to Salieri\" (\"so you can imagine what kind of opera it is\") and proves that he's not merely a clown by skillfully performing a set of waltzes and lullabies. In addition, two of his best-loved sketches are nonmusical: Inflationary Language, in which numbers in language, like the economy, are increased (\"I'll go back to Elevenessee.... Three-dleoo.\"), and Phonetic Punctuation, in which a period is read aloud to sound like fft and an exclamation point fsss fft.

But they rise to the challenge with the help of their guardian-creator, Professor Utonium. In the Emmy-nominated title episode, Bubbles gets fed up with being \"the cute one,\" while her comrades get the better assignments, so she takes on a series of ugly baddies, resulting in many fires and explosions. There are five episodes on this 60-minute tape, including the double-episode \"Uh-Oh Dynamo,\" which finds the girls battling a monster at the city park. The trio finally vanquishes it from inside a huge robot, but not before the entire downtown appears leveled. In \"Mr. Mojo's Rising,\" the girls must rescue the professor when he is kidnapped by an evil megabrained monkey. \"Powerpuff Bluff\" introduces three hoodlums who impersonate the girls and rip off Townsville's denizens, landing the real girls a spell in the pokey. \"Cat Man Do\" will teach youngsters to go the shelter for their pets, as the kitty (voiced by Mark Hamill) the gals \"rescue\" from a crimelord's compound turns out to be a mind- controlling fiend.

Then a karate chop to Eddie's head later, they're at the mercy of a happily married pair of thieves (Rhea Perlman, Jerry Van Dyke) and, ultimately, a team of spooked runaway horses posing as reindeer. Luckily Eddie already has a crush on Mom, who manages his favorite mini-mart, and together the pair track down the missing twins, who, meanwhile, are having the ride of their lives. The Olsen twins are in their Full House bloom in this 89-minute made-for-TV movie, which means their brand of innocuous brattiness is still more charming than annoying.

The Big E plays race-car driver Lucky Jackson, who arrives in Las Vegas for an upcoming Grand Prix race. Lucky's car needs a new engine, so he gets a waiter job at a casino and starts working his crooning charms on Rusty Martin (Ann-Margret). It's their on-screen chemistry that makes this flick a lot of fun; Presley never had a better costar than Ann-Margret, and their race-car romance is quintessential 1960s fluff. Then there are the songs, of course, including the snappy title tune, a rockin' rendition of Ray Charles's \"What'd I Say?,\" and \"The Yellow Rose of Texas.\" Viva Las Vegas is one of the Elvis movies that stands the test of time, when the legend was still at his peak. And if you're wondering if the King gets his car fixed in time to win the race, well, check out the movie to find out. --Jeff Shannon","details":"Product details Aspect Ratio ‏ : ‎ 2.35:1 Is Discontinued By Manufacturer ‏ : ‎ No MPAA rating ‏ : ‎ Unrated (Not Rated) Product Dimensions ‏ : ‎ 7.5 x 5.38 x 0.6 inches; 4 ounces Media Format ‏ : ‎ Color, Widescreen, Closed-captioned, NTSC Run time ‏ : ‎ 1 hour and 25 minutes Release date ‏ : ‎ August 20, 1997 Actors ‏ : ‎ Viva Las Vegas Subtitles: ‏ : ‎ English, Spanish, French Language ‏ : ‎ English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Unqualified (Dolby Digital 1.0) Studio ‏ : ‎ MGM (Video & DVD) ASIN ‏ : ‎ 0792836030 Number of discs ‏ : ‎ 1 Best Sellers Rank: #220,185 in Movies & TV (See Top 100 in Movies & TV) #9,215 in Dance Pop (CDs & Vinyl) #166,546 in DVD Customer Reviews: 4.7 4.7 out of 5 stars 3,865 ratings","title":"Viva Las Vegas"});
